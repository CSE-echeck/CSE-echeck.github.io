        <p> Hello! My name is Erin Check. I am a student at the University of South Carolina Honors College studying computer science
            with a minor in cybersecurity. I am passionate about my cybersecurity minor and I can't wait to dive deeper into it and learn more about it.
            My goal is to work in cybersecurity for the government and learn as much as possible! </p>

                <p>These sketches show a user interaction with the app to choose their breakfast option in the mornings. They have the option between choosing in person or online and delivery and what they want to eat if they choose that option. This makes it much easier for students to see breakfast options all in one spot.</p>
